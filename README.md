# ðŸ“¡ WiFi Exploitation Framework ðŸ“¡

A fully offensive framework to the 802.11 networks and protocols with different types of attacks for WPA/WPA2 and WEP, automated hash cracking, bluetooth hacking and much more.

Tested and supported in **Kali Linux**, **Parrot OS**, **Arch Linux** and **Ubuntu**

*\*However it's not finished and may have issues, try it at your own risk.\**

- I recommend you my alfa adapter: **Alfa AWUS036ACM**, which works really great with both, 2.4 and 5 Ghz

- If you have any doubt, please contact me or create a issue

Once the application is running, type `help` to view more functions and useful info.

If you don't want to scan APs with every attack you can do something like this:

```sh
set name my-wifi # To especify the name to attack
set time 60 # To define the total duration of the attacks that ask for the time
set packets 15 # To define the amount of packets that some attacks will send
```
